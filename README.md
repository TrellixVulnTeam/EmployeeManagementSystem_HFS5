# EmployeeManagementSystem
Full-stack CRUD application using Angular and Spring Boot.

In this project, I developed a CRUD full-stack web application that illustrates a basic UI (User Interface) for Employee Managemeent Application using Angular 10 and Spring Boot.
This application contains CRUD features such as:
- Create Employee
- List Employee
- Update Employee
- Delete Employee
- View Employee

After finishing the project, I have learned:
- How to develop a CRUD full-stack application with Angular front-end and Spring Boot back-end.
- How to build RESTful APIs with Spring Boot.
- How to connect front-end (Angular) to back-end RESTful API (Spring Boot).
- How to connect REST APIs to JPA/Hibernate with Spring Boot.
- How to use a wide variety of Spring Boot Starter Projects - Spring Boot Web, and Spring Boot Data JPA.
